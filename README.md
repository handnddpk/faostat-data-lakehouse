## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)
- **Compute**: Apache Spark 3.5
- **Table Format**: Apache Iceberg
- **Catalog**: PostgreSQL (JDBC)
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit

### Data Flow (Medallion Architecture)
```
FAOSTAT API
    ↓
[Bronze Layer] Raw data in Iceberg tables
    ↓
[Silver Layer] Cleaned, structured data
    ↓
[Gold Layer] Business metrics & aggregations
    ↓
Streamlit Dashboard
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services
make start

# Run the pipeline manually
make run-pipeline

# Access services
# MinIO:    http://localhost:9001 (admin/password)
# Spark:    http://localhost:8080
# Airflow:  http://localhost:8081 (admin/admin)
# Dashboard: http://localhost:8501
```

## 📊 Data Pipeline

### 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- **Input**: FAOSTAT bulk downloads
  - QCL: Crops and livestock products
  - TCL: Trade data (imports/exports)
- **Output**: 
  - `lakehouse.bronze.faostat_qcl_raw`
  - `lakehouse.bronze.faostat_tcl_raw`

### 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned Data)
- **Transformations**:
  - Filter relevant elements (Production, Exports, Imports)
  - Standardize column names
  - Clean data types
  - Remove nulls
- **Output**:
  - `lakehouse.silver.crop_production`
  - `lakehouse.silver.trade_data`

### 3. Gold Layer (Business Metrics)
- **Analytics**:
  - Yearly production by crop
  - Top crops globally
  - Trade balance (exports - imports)
  - Food security indicators
- **Output**:
  - `lakehouse.gold.yearly_crop_production`
  - `lakehouse.gold.top_crops`
  - `lakehouse.gold.trade_balance`
  - `lakehouse.gold.food_security_indicators`

### Key Metrics Calculated
- **Self-Sufficiency Ratio** = Production / (Production + Imports)
- **Production Growth Rate** = (Current Year - Previous Year) / Previous Year
- **Trade Balance** = Exports - Imports
- **Net Position** = Net Exporter | Net Importer | Balanced

## 📈 Business Insights Generated

1. **Production Trends**: Which crops are growing/declining?
2. **Trade Dependencies**: Which countries rely on imports?
3. **Food Security Risk**: Countries with low self-sufficiency
4. **Regional Analysis**: Production patterns by geography
5. **Crop Priorities**: Most important crops globally

### Sample Findings
- Countries with <50% self-sufficiency are high risk
- Declining production growth indicates capacity issues
- Net importers are vulnerable to supply disruptions
